# Borderless

Many workers, such as those in developing countries and in fields like health care and humanitarian aid, are in the field for weeks at a time without any access to the Internet, yet still need to record the data they collect. Currently, they must carry around bulky, time-consuming paper forms. With Borderless, users can dynamically create form templates and collect data while offline using a simple web application. Additionally, users can review the information they have collected on the go and leverage data analysis and visualization tools, even when they are still offline. When they return to an Internet connection, they can sync their data to the master database and download the data their colleagues have collected.
