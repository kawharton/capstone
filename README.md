# Borderless

Many workers in developing countries, especially in fields like health care, are in the field for weeks at a time without any access to the Internet, yet still need to record the data they collect. Currently, they must carry around bulky, time-consuming paper forms. With Borderless, users can collect data while offline for long periods of time using simple web forms that they can create and edit. They can also review the data they've collected on the go, and leverage data analysis and visualization tools. When they return to an Internet connection, they can sync their data to the full database, and download the data their colleagues have collected.
